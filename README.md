# ETL_Project
Final versions of group ETL Project work

As a newly formed research team at the World Marine Biological Center (WMBC), we were tasked with investigating the impact that the fishing industries of different countries have on the fish species of the North Atlantic. In order to conduct our analysis, we found multiple datasets which contained this information. By combining the data in a single database, we were able to more readily conduct our analysis. 
The following technical report outlines the steps taken by our team to clean, combine, store, and then access the data.

See the MS Word document in this repo for further detail on this project.
